	  Using a photo sharing site that's not on the list?

  </p>
	<h4>Can I submit URLs shortened with my favorite shortener?</h4>
	<p>
	  You betcha!
	</p>
	<h4>I tweeted a link to my photo, but it's not showing up on the site.  What gives?</h4>
	<p>
	  Double-check that your tweet includes an assignment hashtag in the
	  form <tt>#dsxxx</tt> (<a href="http://twitter.com/clarkware/status/7427955198">example</a>)
	  and a URL that resolves to one of the photo sharing sites mentioned above.
	</p>
	<h4>How often are submissions processed?</h4>
	<p>
	  Every 15 minutes the Daily Shoot elves process new tweets mentioning @dailyshoot. When they're done, you'll
    see a thumbnail of your photo on the front page (if it's recent enough), the assignment page, and your
    photog page.
	</p>
	<h4>How do I navigate through the slideshow?</h4>
	<p>
	  Click on any thumbnail to see a medium-size format of the photo. Hover over the photo and you'll get left
    and right arrows to click. Or simply use the left and right arrow keys to hop through the photos without
    using the mouse. Pressing the Enter key will take you directly to the original photo on its photo sharing
    site.
	</p>
	<h4>So I can't comment on a photo from within the Daily Shoot site?</h4>
	<p>
	  That's correct. We feel commenting should happen on whichever photo sharing site a photographer chooses to
    use. It's not because we're too lazy to implement it on this site. Rather, we don't want to inadvertently
    fragment a photographer's commenting community. Flickr users, for example, live for comments!
	</p>
	<h4>Why only show 30 photos on any given page?</h4>
	<p>
	  Because, in the case of Flickr, we want to abide by the Flickr API Terms of Use which limits the number of
    photos we can show per page to 30.
	</p>
  <h4>Is The Daily Shoot a contest?</h4>
	<p>
	  Nope. You won't get any gold stars for doing every assignment, nor will you get demerits if you miss a few
    days. We're just here to help you with a little nudge every day. The rest is up to you!
	</p>
	<h4>What are the rules?</h4>
	<p>
	  This is your creative work - there are no rules.
	</p>
	<h4>Can I submit previously-taken photos from my collection?</h4>
	<p>
	  We won't stop you, but responding to today's assignment with a photo from
	  last year's summer vacation doesn't really help you grow as a photographer.
	  The whole point of The Daily Shoot is to encourage you to
	  get out there and make something new and fresh every day!
	</p>
	<h4>Can I submit more than one photo per assignment?</h4>
	<p>
	  You can, but we'd suggest you submit your <em>best</em> photo for each assignment.
	  Choosing your best exercises your editing skills, and that's valuable, too.
	</p>
	<h4>Are you looking for assignment suggestions?</h4>
	<p>
	  We thought you'd never ask.
