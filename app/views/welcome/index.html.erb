		  Photography is an art and a craft. Getting better at both requires practice&mdash;lots
      of practice. <strong> The Daily Shoot is a simple daily routine to motivate and
      inspire you to practice your photography, and share your results!</strong> It&rsquo;s
      not a contest and there are no prizes. It's simply about encouraging you to pick up
      your camera and make photographs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's easy to get started! Here&rsquo;s how:
		</p>

    <ol style="padding-left: 2em;">
      <li>
        <p>
          <a href="http://twitter.com/dailyshoot">Follow @dailyshoot</a> on Twitter. Every
          day at 10 am EST (2 pm GMT) a new photo assignment is posted to the @dailyshoot
          Twitter account.  The assignment is tweeted again at 8 pm EST (12 am GMT) as a 
          reminder.  Some assignments are simple to help you keep the momentum, and
          others are more challenging to push you to learn something new.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When you make a photo for the assignment you want to share, simply upload it to one of the 
          <%= link_to "supported photo sharing sites", faq_url %>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Tweet a link to your photo mentioning @dailyshoot and the assignment&rsquo;s
          hashtag (<a href="http://twitter.com/clarkware/status/7427955198">example</a>).
          Several times an hour the Daily Shoot elves process these tweets and add thumbnails to
          your photos on this site.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

		<p>Two suggestions: First, don't short change yourself by responding to an assignment with an old picture. Get out there and make something new and fresh. Second, while it's easy to take lots of shots, choose your best one to link to with your tweet. Choosing your best exercises your editing skills, and that's valuable too.</p>
        
		<p>That's it. There aren't any other rules. You aren't going to get demerits if you miss a few days, nor will you get gold stars for doing every assignment. We're just here to help you with a little nudge every day. The rest is up to you!</p>
