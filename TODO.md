* Filter out RTs from assignment tweets so that we avoid duplications? OR, maybe use the RT to signal that we should test to see if we have a dup?

* Test that Flickr set URLs are handled properly on the collection

* Figure out how to support Tumblr photos

* Expand bit.ly and tinyurl links to see if they're a link we support

* Pagination for photos and photogs, at a minimum

* Fancy animation of front 30 pics with additional groups of 30. Maybe crossfade the entire set or do some sort of random replace shuffle bit.

* If viewer is a user and admin, enable pop ups on the various photo thumbnails to delete or refresh the thumbnail URL.
